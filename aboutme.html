  <h5>Learning Python on June 20</h5>
  <p>To me learning Python was more about critical thinking and puzzle solving. It was also new to me because you have to be aware of all of the syntax so the computer can recognize your commands. I think it has been interesting so far, and I'm looking forward to applying these concepts to more advanced projects. I am realizing now that coding allows for a lot of flexibility when creating, which is really cool. It is just executing the code that seems difficult at this moment.</p>
  
  <h5>Making Shapes in Python on Atom</h5>
  <p>Today I worked on making shapes with Python while using an application called Atom on the laptop. First we had to draw a square and a triange using a turtle graphic. Then we took it a step forward and incorporated user input into the code by inputting questions for picking the color of the shapes. Then I made another file so the user could pick out color and number of shapes. I had to debug the code a lot at this point because I was getting errors when running the code. This was because of syntax problems such as using strings instead of integers, or forgetting a colon. Lastly I made a flower graphic where I used the fill function, and this file took me the longest to work on. This is because figuring out the angles of roation were confusing. Luckily in the end I got it, and got a pink flower with an orange center.</p>
  
  <h5>Data structures,Lists, Tuples, Functions June 23</h5>
  <p>A list is a group of numbers or strings called under a variable name. It is useful because you can group data together, or call specific items at specific positions from the list. I worked best with the group consisting of Christina, Rachel, and Anatti because we all communicated well and it was fun talking about what we were coding. I like that python gives a lot of flexibilty in solving the same problem in different ways. I was also able to condense my code to make it more efficient. It was really fun solving all of the problems and breaking down the thought process of the math involved in solving the problems.</p>
  
  <h5>Robotics and Circuits</h5>
  <p>My ideas about robots changed because robots are more automatic and high functioning machines than just computers or phones, even if computers and phones are very powerful. I am excited that life will improve for most people with the integration of robotics into everyday life, like driving. I am nervous that robots can malfunction or have bugs in the code, which can make them dangerous. We also worked on Board of Education shields to make simple LED circuits, and all of our simple projects turned out really well. Next time we could try using more LEDs, or make more complex projects on the circuit boards.</p>
  
  <h5>Escape Bot</h5>
  <p>Today we coded our Arduino bot that can respond to its enviornments by using sensors. We put infared sensors on the breadboard and coded a program on Arduino so that if no objects are in front of the bot, the bot moves forward. If there is an object in front of the bot, it will turn away. In the code, if the sensor detected something in front of it, then it outputted the value 0. If not, it outputted a value of 1.</p>
  
  <h>The Internet and Cybersecurity on July 14</h5>
  <p>The internet is the connected network of computers all over the world. Framework is a software template that can be personalized for its specific user or functionality. Phishing is when a hacker tries to aquire personal information online by posing as a reputable corporation organization.</p>
